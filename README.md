# FUTURE_CS_02-Security-Alert-Monitoring-Incident-Response
Security Alert Monitoring &amp; Incident Response. Includes simulated SIEM alert monitoring, incident classification, and a detailed incident response report with remediation recommendations.
# Cybersecurity Internship - Task 2  
**Security Alert Monitoring & Incident Response**  

## 📌 Task Overview  
Monitor simulated security alerts using a SIEM tool, identify suspicious activities, classify incidents, and draft an incident response report.  

## 🛠️ Tools Used  
- Elastic Stack (ELK)  
- Splunk Free Trial  
- Sample Log Files  

## 🎯 Skills Gained  
- Log Analysis  
- Alert Triage  
- Incident Classification  
- SOC Operations Basics  

## 📑 Deliverable  
- [Incident Response Report](Incident_Response_Report.docx)  

## 📊 Key Findings  
- Multiple failed login attempts → Possible brute-force attack.  
- Successful login after failed attempts → Account compromise.  
- Privilege escalation detected → Post-compromise activity.  

## 🔒 Remediation Recommendations  
- Enforce strong password policies & enable MFA.  
- Block suspicious IPs and monitor login attempts.  
- Reset credentials of compromised accounts.  
- Patch vulnerabilities to prevent privilege escalation.  
- Implement continuous monitoring with SIEM tools.
